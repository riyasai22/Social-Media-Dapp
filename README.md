# Social-Media-Dapp

## Abstract

One of the key components of the new internet-based society is social networking. It gave us access to new channels for business, education, and so forth. The internet used to only consist of text-based HTML pages. which we once referred to as web 1.0. The interactive media was the next iteration. Web 2.0 has changed the way we use the internet today. The foundation of every social network is this technology. Major corporations also control it.People divulge their personal information in return for free services. Governments frequently filter or control these services. The new internet standard is called Web 3.0. It is semantic and decentralized. This indicates that it has AI and that the System lacks a central control node. Therefore, we may create a new social networking system that is similar to open source with the aid of this new technology. To prevent the use of private data for commercial advantage, it will not be owned by any corporation. Web 3.0 cannot, however,
be censored or controlled by any government or other governing entity due to its decentralized structure.
